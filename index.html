        <p>Hello! My name is Daryl Jubasan and I am from the Philippines.</p>
        <p>I am currently studying Web Design and Development at BYU Idaho. I have always been fascinated by the
            world of web development and design, and I am excited to learn more about it through this program. In my
            free time, I enjoy watching movies and playing video games.</p>
